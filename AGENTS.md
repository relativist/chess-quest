# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync bd JSONL
```

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete the applicable steps below. For this project, implemented work is not complete until the corresponding `bd` issue is closed.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Sync bd state** - run `bd sync` when useful to refresh `.beads/issues.jsonl`. Do not run git commit or git push; the user handles git publishing.
   ```bash
   bd sync
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Stop local dev servers you started and note any unfinished work
6. **Verify** - bd state is updated and quality gates were run when code changed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Implemented task work is NOT complete until the corresponding `bd` issue is closed
- Use `bd update <id> --status in_progress` when starting a tracked task
- Use `bd close <id> --reason "Completed"` after verification succeeds
- Do not run git commit or git push; the user handles git publishing

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- File-friendly: auto-syncs issues to JSONL
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

Project-specific rule: when implementing a tracked task, start it with `bd update <id> --status in_progress` and close it with `bd close <id> --reason "Completed"` only after verification succeeds. Prefer `bd ready --type task` for choosing executable work; epics are planning containers.

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Auto-Sync

bd keeps the JSONL export in sync:

- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer
- No manual export/import needed!

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems
